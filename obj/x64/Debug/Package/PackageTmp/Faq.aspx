            Q. Does this policy take the place of my home owner's policy coverage?
        </p>
        <p class="begin"><b>A. </b>Most homeowner's policies provide coverage for you and your family and exclude business exposures. There are expensive endorsements that provide limited coverage for in home business ventures. This program provides coverage that will follow you wherever you are conducting business. Whether a person is in business one day or ten years, the most mundane event can cause someone to sue. Just the cost of defense can take everything away that a person and their family have planned and worked for, even if they win. One can always get sued whether they are at fault or not. Here are a few examples outside a fair or show which can result in a lawsuit: cause damage to someone’s property, table or floor, Injure a host, guest or child. The Liability Policy provides coverage for claims related to your business activities away from your home. WHEN DEALING WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.</p>
        <p class="begin" style="font-weight: bold">
            Q. Does this policy protect me if someone gets hurt at one of my parties or sales appointments?
        </p>
        <p class="begin"><b>A.</b> Yes, the host or customer's home owner's policy may also provide some protection, but this policy gives you protection regardless of whether other policy coverage may be available. It removes any questions if there is coverage or not.</p>
        <p class="begin" style="font-weight: bold">
            Q. If I buy this policy as a sales leader with a downline, does the policy also cover my downline team members?
        </p>
        <p class="begin"><b>A.</b> No. Each individual independent seller must purchase their own coverage. One fee does not provide coverage on any other independent sales person. This policy covers your personal sales and related business activities. For example, it will cover any claims arising from anyone that is somehow injured when attending one of your training sessions, should you be found negligent. It will not cover a claim made arising out of an individual business activity of your downline members. They must purchase their own policy.</p>
        <p class="begin" style="font-weight: bold">
            Q. If I leave the business can I cancel the one year subscription?
        </p>
        <p class="begin"><b>A.</b> No, the annual fee paid is non-refundable.</p>
        <p class="begin" style="font-weight: bold">
            Q. If I leave my current company and join another direct selling company, can I continue my coverage under the policy?
        </p>
        <p class="begin"><b>A.</b> No. The policy is individual to you and is contingent upon your independent contractor status with each particular company. The only qualifying conditions for being a policy holder are: You must be an Independent Distributor seller in good standing with your represented direct selling company and a member of the Independent Direct Seller Association (IDSA). You must be an active Independent Distributor/Consultant at the time of loss for loss arising out of your sales activities.</p>
